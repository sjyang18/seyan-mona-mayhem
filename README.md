> **Turn GitHub contribution graphs into a retro battle arena.**
>
> Learn modern AI-assisted development workflows with **VS Code** or **GitHub Copilot CLI** while building a playful Astro app.

A workshop template for building a retro arcade-themed website with Astro that compares GitHub contribution graphs of two users. This is the **starting point** — you'll build the app step by step using GitHub Copilot.

*What you'll build by the end of the workshop*

## ✨ Why this repo

- 🕹️ **Fun output**: build a game-like site instead of another TODO app
- 🤖 **Agentic workflow practice**: prompts, planning, delegated tasks, and review loops
- 🧭 **Two learning paths**: choose VS Code or CLI based on how you work
- 🧱 **Practical stack**: Astro, API routes, and deploy-ready structure

## 🚀 Start in 3 steps

1. **Create your own repo** from this template (or fork it).
2. **Pick your track** (VS Code or Copilot CLI).
3. **Begin here**: [Workshop Overview](workshop/00-overview.md).

## 📚 Workshop

The workshop supports two tracks — follow the one that matches your preferred workflow:

- **VS Code track** — Chat, Plan Mode, Agent Mode, background agents, and editor-native review loops
- **CLI track** — `copilot`, `@file` context, `/plan`, autonomous edits, `/fleet`, `/delegate`, and `/review`

| Part | Title | Copilot Focus |
|------|-------|---------------|
| [00](workshop/00-overview.md) | Overview | Track selection and learning goals |
| [01](workshop/01-setup.md) | Setup & Context Engineering | Instructions, permissions, and environment setup |
| [02](workshop/02-plan-and-scaffold.md) | Plan & Scaffold | Planning the API and page architecture |
| [03](workshop/03-agent-mode.md) | Build the Game | Agentic implementation and iteration |
| [04](workshop/04-design-vibes.md) | Design-First Theming | Visual design planning and implementation |
| [05](workshop/05-polish.md) | Polish & Parallel Work | Parallelism, reviews, and quality passes |
| [06](workshop/06-bonus.md) | Bonus & Extensions | Open-ended feature ideas and extra Copilot experiments |

## 🧰 Choose your setup

- **VS Code track**
  - Clone your repo and open it in VS Code.
  - Use Chat, Plan Mode, Agent Mode, and editor-native review loops.
- **CLI track**
  - Clone your repo locally and install `copilot`.
  - Use `/plan`, `/delegate`, `/fleet`, and `/review` from your terminal.

## Prerequisites

### Shared

- GitHub Copilot (Pro, Business, or Enterprise)
- Git
- Node.js

### VS Code track

- VS Code v1.107+
- GitHub Copilot extension signed in

### CLI track

- GitHub Copilot CLI (`copilot`)
- Node.js 22+ if you plan to install the CLI via `npm install -g @github/copilot`
- Or Homebrew / WinGet if you prefer a native package manager install

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: [Astro](https://astro.build/) v6
- **Runtime**: Node.js with [@astrojs/node](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/) adapter
- **Font**: Press Start 2P (retro gaming font)
- **API**: GitHub's contribution graph API

## ▶️ Run locally

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

## Deployment Notes

### Current GitHub Pages setup

The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` currently deploys static workshop/docs content from `docs/` and `workshop/` to GitHub Pages. It does not build or deploy the Astro app from `src/`.

### If you want to deploy the Astro app to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is static hosting, so the Astro app should use static output.

1. Change `output` in `astro.config.mjs` from `server` to `static`.
2. Remove the Node adapter (`@astrojs/node`) from `astro.config.mjs` and `package.json`.
3. Update the GitHub Actions workflow to run `npm ci` and `npm run build`, then upload `dist/` as the Pages artifact.
4. If deploying to a project page (`https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`), set `site` and `base` in `astro.config.mjs`.

If you plan to keep API routes running in production, use a server platform instead of GitHub Pages (for example, Vercel, Netlify, or a Node host).
